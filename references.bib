    is, resolving it, and learning from it. Working on a software project
    includes managing the bugs we find. At first, we might list them
    on a spreadsheet. But when the number of bugs becomes too large and
    a lot of people must access and input data on them, we have to give
    up the spreadsheet and instead use a bug- or issue-tracking system.
    Many software projects reach this point, especially during testing
    and deployment when users tend to find an application's bugs. Nowadays
    we can choose among dozens of bug-tracking systems. This paper looks
    at two specific open source products and provides useful hints for
    working with any bug-tracking tool.},
