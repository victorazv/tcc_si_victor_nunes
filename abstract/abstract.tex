This finals period uses elements of software engineering to propose software as a service to optimize the process of building and maintaining the software. Thus, the goal of this project is to generate access permissions to client systems, providing the reuse of software and standardizing as solutions. The system proposed in this work is implemented and available at Github, bringing fundamentals about the architecture and technologies used, as well as evaluations on possibilities of using it in various environments, such as Web and mobile.
